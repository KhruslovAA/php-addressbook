# PHP AddressBook

A simple Object Oriented book for saving people addresses, written with PHP.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.1
* (optional) PHPUnit to run tests.

## Install

Via Composer:

```bash
$ composer require alex/addressbook"
```

## Basic usage of `addressbook`

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
use Addressbook\Book;
use Addressbook\Person;
use Addressbook\Group;

$book = new Book();
```

## Add new Person
You should add the new person with the next options 'Person(id, firstname, lastname, address[], email[], phone[], groupname[])'
```php
<?php
// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
use Addressbook\Book;
use Addressbook\Person;
use Addressbook\Group;

$book = new Book();
$book::addPerson(new Person('1', 'firstName1', 'lastName1', ['address1', 'address2', 'address3'], ['email1@dgdfg', 'email2', 'email3'], ['phone1', 'phone2', 'phone3'], ['group1', 'group2', 'group3']));
```

## Add new Group
You should add the new group with the next options 'Group(id, name)'
```php
<?php
// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
use Addressbook\Book;
use Addressbook\Person;
use Addressbook\Group;

$book = new Book();
$book::addGroup(new Group('1', 'group1'));
```

## Get Persons by name (first name / last name / full name)
You can get the list of persons that were added earlier and who have the needed name
```php
<?php
// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
use Addressbook\Book;
use Addressbook\Person;
use Addressbook\Group;

$book = new Book();
print_r(Book::getPersonByName('firstName1 lastName1'));
```

## Get Persons by email or email index
You can get the list of persons that were added earlier and who have the needed email or email index. 
For example, search and results could be the next:
- if you search 'alex', the result could be 'alex@gmail.com', 'alex@i.ua' etc.
- if you search 'alex@gmail.com', the result could be 'alex@gmail.com'.
```php
<?php
// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
use Addressbook\Book;
use Addressbook\Person;
use Addressbook\Group;

$book = new Book();
print_r(Book::getPersonByEmail('email'));
```

## Get Persons from the group
You can see the list of persons that were added earlier and who have the needed group. 
```php
<?php
// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
use Addressbook\Book;
use Addressbook\Person;
use Addressbook\Group;

$book = new Book();
print_r($book::getPersonByGroupName('group1'));
```

## Get Person groups
You can see the list of person's groups. Before that you should add persons with all needed data. 
```php
<?php
// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
use Addressbook\Book;
